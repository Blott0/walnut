# Walnut Application Assignment

Simple brand-listing app for Walnut.

A secure implementation has been built for requesting an API token.

✔ The token gets closed/deleted after each request.

✔ It is required to show the following information in the visual table:
Identifier, Logo, and Title of the brands.

✔ Swap out one of the logos of the available brands for a picture of a little duck each time the list gets loaded.

✔ The page must have a search function available to search through the
titles of the brands.

✔ There is a form available for creating a new brand.

✔ It is not visually un-appealing.

✔ The design of the website is enhanced by the use of Tailwindcss.

✔ The website has an inspection page that allows users to inspect a
brand.

✖ Users have the ability to 'archive' a brand, which means it will no
longer be displayed on the main page.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
